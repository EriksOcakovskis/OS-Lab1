# Lab 1

## Configure keyboard language

    loadkeys us

## Step 1 (Set up the connectivity)

### (OPTIONAL) Temporary IP

Check what Ip's are assigned

    ifconfig -a | grep inet

Temporary configure IP

    sudo ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.100 netmask 255.255.255.0

Set default gateway

    sudo route add default gw 10.0.0.1 eth0

Check that routes are correct

    route -n

Add DNS

    nameserver 8.8.8.8

To remove temporary configuration

    ip addr flush eth0


### Static IP

Edit /etc/network/interfaces file with following command

    nano /etc/network/interfaces

Below you will find example of configuration

Lines below are for [lab](https://i-tee.itcollege.ee) server
(Pointed out by [Mikus](https://github.com/mikust)

    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
    address 10.0.0.100/24
    gateway 10.0.0.1

Enable the interface by executing

    sudo ifup eth0

Disable the interface by executing

    sudo ifdown eth0

Additional info found in [Ubuntu network configuration](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/network-configuration.html)

### Setup ssh connection with Ed25519-SHA-512 algorithm

Generate keys on both machines

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 1000

Copy public keys between machines

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub student@IP-address

Alternative if ssh-copy-id does not work

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@<hostname> 'umask 0077; mkdir -p .ssh; cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys && echo "Key copied"'

---

## Step 2Â (Work with files)

### Folders

Create required directories

    sudo -i
    mkdir -p /root/lab1/user{01..50}

Move directories

    mv /root/lab1/user01 /root/lab1/user02/
    mv /root/lab1/user03 /root/lab1/user02/user01/

Delete directories

    rm -r /root/lab1/user04


### Moving

    cd ../../
    cd ~
    cd /etc/apt

### Searching

    find /var/log -name *.log

    cat /etc/network/interfaces | gerp auto
or

    grep /etc/network/interfaces -e "auto"

### Permissions

Change permissions for group in directory /root/lab1/user05

    chmod -R g-rwx /root/lab1/user05

Add a group audio2

    groupadd audio2

Change group ownership

    chown -R :audio2 /root/lab1/user05

### Viewing

    less /var/log/syslog

In less finding a string sda

    :/sda

Find next occurrence of sda by pressing 'n'.

Go to start of file by pressing 'p'.

Go to end of file by typing

    :100

and press 'p'.

---

## Step 3 (Work with processes)

    top

Put top in background by ^z.

View all the background jobs

    jobs

Move job id 1 to foreground

    fg %1

Kill top

    pkill top

or by job id

    kill %1

Find process lines with 'root' in them

    ps aux | grep root

Redirect output

    ls -l >> permissions.txt

## Step 4 (User management)

Create a user

    useradd -d /home/sysadmin -m -s /bin/bash sysadmin

Add a group

    groupadd devops

Add user to group

    usermod -a -G devops sysadmin

Lock user

    usermod -L -e 1 sysadmin

Change user name

    usermod -l sysadmin2 sysadmin

Change users home folder

    usermod -d /home/sysadmin2 -m sysadmin2

(OPTIONAL) Unlock user

    usermod -U -e 99999 sysadmin2

Unlock if user does not have password

    usermod -p sysadmin2

## Step 5 (Software management)

Installing programs

    apt-get install mc

Check version

    mc --version

Check shared library dependencies

(IMPORTANT) Be aware that in some circumstances (e.g., where the program
specifies an ELF interpreter other than ld-linux.so), some versions
of ldd may attempt to obtain the dependency information by attempting
to directly execute the program (which may lead to the execution of
whatever code is defined in the program's ELF interpreter, and
perhaps to execution of the program itself).  Thus, you should never
employ ldd on an untrusted executable, since this may result in the
execution of arbitrary code.

    ldd /usr/bin/mc

A safer alternative when dealing with untrusted executables is

    objdump -p /usr/bin/mc | grep NEEDED

Or

    readelf -d /usr/bin/mc | grep NEEDED

(OPTIONAL) Check shared library dependencies for a running process

    pmap 2345 | grep lib

Refresh software repositories

    apt-get update

Find programs which name or description contain a word "monitoring"

    apt-cache search monitoring

Full software upgrade

    apt-get dist-upgrade

Shutdown the system

    systemctl poweroff / halt
    sudo poweroff / halt
